function [w,t]=morletw(fs,a,b,ki,timeunits,woo)

%MORLETW  Calculate the Morlet Wavelet.
%
%         W = MORLETW (FS,SC) calculates the Morlet wavelet
%         at scale SC sampled at rate FS.
%
%         W = MORLETW (FS,SC,SHF) calculates the Morlet wavelet
%         at scale SC, sampled at rate FS and delayed SHF seconds.
%
%         W = MORLETW (FS,SC,SHF,TIM) calculates the Morlet wavelet
%         at scale SC, sampled at rate FS and delayed SHF seconds,
%         changing the time interval to -TIM:TIM seconds.
%
%         W = MORLETW (FS,SC,SHF,TIM,TIMEUNITS) makes the wavelet be
%         expressed in terms of TIMEUNITS instead of seconds. The default
%         value of TIMEUNITS is 1 (seconds). Example: 0.001 = milliseconds. 
%         A value of 0 means the default (1).
%
%         W = MORLETW (FS,SC,SHF,TIM,TIMEUNITS,W0) changes the central 
%         frequency of the wavelet to W0. The default value is 2*PI.  
%
%         The SC scale wavelet is calculated by compressing or expanding
%         the scale 1 wavelet. This last is computed in the interval 
%         -TIM:TIM timeunits, and compressions or dilations modify this
%         interval too. The default value for TIM is 6 time units, since
%         the values of the Morlet wavelet are negligible for ABS(t)>6 t.u.
%
%         [W,T] = MORLETW (FS,SC,SHF,TIM,TIMEUNITS,W0) also returns
%         the time basis for the desired wavelet, in TIMEUNITS.
