function s=maxrsize(lw,k)

% MAXRSIZE  Maximum recoverable size from a Wavelet transform
%
%           MAXRSIZE (LW,K) returns the size of the largest
%           vector that can be reconstructed from the K-scales
%           wavelet transform of length LW. This maximum size
%           can be the same as LW or LW+1 (because of the 
%           transformation method)
%
%	    If there's no vector whose K-scales Wavelet transform
%           is LW samples long, the return value is 0.
