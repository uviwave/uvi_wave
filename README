= What is the Wavelet Toolbox =
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This Wavelet Toolbox for Matlab intends to help the researches and 
education professionals interested on any of the possibilities that 
Wavelet Processing offers.

We hope the tools developed into a widely used environment as Matlab,
can be easily accepted by the scientific community. 

In the next paragraphs, a short description of the main features of the
Uvi_Wave Toolbox can be found.


- Discrete Wavelet Transform:  calculation and visualization of 
the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Inverse Discrete Wavelet 
Transform (IDWT) for an unidimensional or bidimensional signal. 
Routines to implement the typical filter bank structure have been 
programmed. 


- Scale Function and Wavelet Function: calculation and visualization of 
the discrete approximation scale and wavelet functions, obtained as the 
equivalent iterated filter that corresponds to the lower branch in the 
filter bank structure.


- Multiresolution analysis:  the objective of these routines
is the representation of the signal information into a set of 
approximation signals and detail signals at different resolutions.


- Wavelet design: design of a set of filters that lead to the wavelet 
decomposition and reconstruction. The selected design algorithms includes
orthogonal (Daubechies, Symlets, Battle-Lemarie, maximally flat, Remez) and
biorthogonal (Spline solution) families. Various filter regularity estimates
are also included.

- Wavelet Packet Transform: calculation of the Discrete Wavelet Packet
Transform for unidimensional or bidimensional signals. The routines allows
to set the filter bank structure, that is, the subband decomposition we want
to perform. Moreover, basis selection algorithms with different cost functions
are included.

- Scalogram: discrete-time simulation of the scalogram of a continous
signal using the Morlet wavelet as analyzing function.  

In addition some demos and utilities for subband managing and viewing
have been included.


Despite the functions are clearly commented, we are working on the
documentation.


= Configuration of the Wavelet Toolbox =
--------------------------------------------------------------------


  * The Subdirectory tree
  """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

   The Wavelet Toolbox's subdirectories are arranged as follows:

        WAVELET_HOME			
		 |
                 |_______ WVT
         	 |_______ WPACKETS
		 |_______ WFILTER
		 |_______ WTUTILS	
		 |_______ WPUTILS
                 |_______ SCAL
		 |_______ WDEMO


   WAVELET_HOME Directory:
	
	This is the root directory, that contains the STARTUP.M 
        file, a brief description of Uvi_Wave and the usage conditions.

   WVT Directory:

        The routines necessary to compute the wavelet transform  
        and to perform a multiresolution analysis can be found here.

   WPACKETS Directory:
	
	Contains all the wavelet packet transform functions, 
	together with some related utilities and the basis
        selection algorithms. Some cost functions that can
        be used with the selection routines are provided.
	
   WFILTER Directory:

	Contains the functions for generating the different filter
	families, together with three regularity estimates.

   WTUTILS Directory:

	This contains all the viewing,  alignment calculation,
        band  extraction/insertion/..., size finding  and most
	other utilities for the 1D-2D wavelet transform.
	
   WPUTILS Directory:

	Contains the viewing, band extraction/insertion/..., size
	finding and miscellanous utilities for the 1D-2D wavelet
	packet transform.
	
   SCAL Directory:

	Contains the functions to compute the sampled Morlet
	wavelet, the scalogram of a sampled continous function and
	a utility for 3D viewing of the scalogram.

   WDEMO Directory:

	Contains some demo programs and some data examples 
	(images and signals)  used in the demos.  A test image 
	generator also exists in this directory.



       All  Wavelet Toolbox's  directories should be loaded into the 
   MATLABPATH variable to execute the toolbox's functions (maybe the
   WDEMO can be left out).  This task is made by the STARTUP.M file,
   but surely this file should be edited to configure the directories
   (at least the local WAVELET_HOME directory).  See the next  point 
   for help on configuring the toolbox.



  * The STARTUP.M file
  """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

   What does Wavelet's STARTUP.M file do?

	- Loads the four directory entries into MATLABPATH

	- Sets a default method for wavelet subband alignment


   Editing the STARTUP.M file:


       The  first  thing  you  find   is  a  global  variable  named 
   WAVELET_HOME_PATH, just before the  "ABOUT THE WAVELET..."  text. 
   There is a pre-installation check to avoid repeating the toolbox's 
   paths in the MATLABPATH variable.
   
       Under this section  there's a  Copyright message  display and 
   the definition of the  WAVELET_HOME_PATH variable. Well,  this is 
   what you must set to your Wavelet Toolbox's home directory.

       If you preserve  the original  directory  tree,  then nothing 
   more  is  to do now.  However,  you may want to change any of the 
   subdirectories.  Then  make it  under the  previous  declaration. 
   There's one string variable for every toolbox's directory. Change
   them as you need.


      The last section of STARTUP.M sets the WTCENTERMETHOD variable
   to its default value of 0.  If you want to start matlab  with any 
   other value, change it here. See help on WTMETHOD from matlab for 
   allowed values of  WTCENTERMETHOD.  The alignment method  can  be 
   set to other value at anytime within the matlab session.
