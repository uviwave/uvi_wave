function  [h,g,rh,rg]=lemarie(num_coefs)

%LEMARIE    Generates the quadrature filters given by Battle and Lemarie.
%
%	    [H,G,RH,RG] = LEMARIE (NUM_COEFS) returns the coeficients of
%	    orthonormal  Battle-Lemarie wavelets. NUM_COEFS specifies the
%           number of coefficients. 
%
%	    H is the analysis lowpass filter, RH the synthesis lowpass 
%	    filter, G the analysis higthpass filter and RG the synthesis
%	    highpass filter.
